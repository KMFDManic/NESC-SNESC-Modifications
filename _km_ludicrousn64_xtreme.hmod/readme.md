- This is a very experimental and not a stable Core! Expect potential crashes!
- ONLY recommended for End Users who want the Xtra Push with their N64 Games!
- It has capability of running 4x+ faster than the real N64 hardware!
- SD Command Line recommended for most users!
- HD Command Line more effective if your system supports Easy/Xtreme Overclock!
- Core Options, FrameSkip, can be set between 0-6, requires restart!
- Audio/Video Synched=Xtreme Mode Activate; Desynched=Ludicrous Mode Activate!
- Some Games run absolutely awesome Synched, others better Desynched!
- If you get glitches, at higher FrameSkip Values, reduce Value on retest!
- Due to Dynarec, SRGB Toggle, via Video Settings, Mandatory on some Games!
- Performance/Speed will be Updated on Many Games in Future, Concurrent Releases!
- Special Thanks to AceNos for the amazing StarFox Ludicrous Picture!
