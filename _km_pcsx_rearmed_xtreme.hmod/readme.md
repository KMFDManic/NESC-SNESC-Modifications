NEON Mode will have overall better compatibility, performance, and speed.

PEOPS Mode is The Psx Emulation Open Source project.  (P.E.Op.S.) contains several open source libraries (plugins).

UNAI Mode is Unai's plugin from PCSX4ALL project.  Faster than P.E.Op.S. but has some glitches.

Note: You can change clock speed to 70 in Core Options, for games such as Parasite Eve 2, NBA Live 98, 2000, 2001, and
a select number of others that will not normally work.  Be sure to have back at 57 for normal game usage to avoid sound
and video stuttering and any other general instability that might arise from mucking about with the clock rate.
